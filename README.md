# <Pre-Work Study Guide>

## Description

This pre-work study guide was created with the goal of preparing myself for future success in the upcoming bootcamp. It consolidates most of the key points I learned in the pre-work into one location, so I could easily refer back to them in the future. The purpose of this is to organize notes and lecture material so that I can increase my comprehension and memory of large amounts of information.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
